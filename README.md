# HousePricePrediction

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location-based feature engineering. The model is trained using regression algorithms to provide accurate price predictions.

# Steps Involved

## Data Collection:

Load the dataset containing real estate information.

## Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Remove duplicate entries.

Convert categorical data into numerical values.

Feature engineering based on location.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions of various features.

Analyze correlation between features and price.

## Feature Selection & Engineering:

Select relevant features affecting price.

Create new derived features where necessary.

## Model Selection & Training:

Train various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).

Evaluate models using appropriate performance metrics.

## Model Evaluation:

Compare models based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.

## Deployment (Optional):

Save the trained model for future use.

Deploy the model using a web app or API.

# Input Features

Size: Total area in square feet.

Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.

Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.

Location: Encoded categorical feature representing the propertyâ€™s area.

Price per square foot: Derived feature to normalize pricing.

# Output

Predicted Price: Estimated price of the property based on input features.

# Requirements

To run this project, install the following dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

# Usage

To train the model, run:

python model.py

# Results

The model achieves a good level of accuracy in predicting property prices. Further optimization can be done using hyperparameter tuning and advanced feature engineering.
